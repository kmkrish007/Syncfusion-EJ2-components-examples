\cf3\b ANDREW BRADLEY (to Everyone)\b0 : \cf1 3:12 PM: I don't understand. As you can see in your sample the files are files not directories. These files do not show as files when using your Explorer online\cf2\par
\cf3\b ANDREW BRADLEY (to Everyone)\b0 : \cf1 3:13 PM: Filezilla has nothing to do with the website/application I have built using the FileExplorer control\cf2\par

\cf3\b Keerthana(Tools-Web) (to Everyone)\b0 : \cf1 3:39 PM: I think with old folders we are getting the issue\cf2\par
\cf3\b ANDREW BRADLEY (to Everyone)\b0 : \cf1 3:39 PM: I have just changed the folder name from Alconbury Molesworth Rems to Alconbury and now showing as all files. Something to do with folder name? Length?\cf2\par

\cf3\b ANDREW BRADLEY (to Everyone)\b0 : \cf1 3:41 PM: It is the length of the folder name that is causing it! Folder name of Test shows all files, Folder name of 'Test with long folder name hope it works' shows all as folders!!!\cf2\par
